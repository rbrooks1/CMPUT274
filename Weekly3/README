course: CMPUT 274 fall 2018

assignment: Weekly exercise 3: Word Frequency

included files: freq.py
                README

instructions:
import sys and from collections import Counter were used
navigate to the proper folder in the terminal and run python3 freq.py <input_file_name>
where <input_file_name> is the name of the file you wish to be read.

Notes:
the style checker is giving a style error of E722 do not use bare except in my read file fumction.
I haven't fixed this because after some research I was not able to find a specific error for reading
files therefore I do not know what specific error to put in the except line.
