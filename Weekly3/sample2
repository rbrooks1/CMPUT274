This frequency analysis program works well
to count the number of words in a plain text file.
However, it does not normalize the words at all,
so HELLO is different from hello which is also
different from Hello! This is one limitation to the 
program.

Another limitation is that punctuation is not removed
before analyzing the words. So for example, the word
"words" is now in quotes and will be considered differently
from any other instance of that word in the file!

For our purposes, the program works well. However,
it is useful to note that sometimes we might want to
consider more normalized text.
