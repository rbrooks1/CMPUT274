assignment: Weekly exercise 1: Password Validator

included files: validator.py
                README

instructions: running from the terminal: to run this code from the terminal
use python3 validator.py.  the instructions on what should be imported follow
import validator and input a string value in place of password for 
validator.validate(password) and an integer value greater than or equal to 8 in
place of n in validator.generate(n).
import string and from random import randint, shuffle are in the global section
of my code so they should also be imported

Notes:
I have a while loop in the generator that checks if the n value is less than 8
and returns Try again
There is a pass statement in the if __name__ == '__main__': section to make sure 
that no EOF error occurs.
