assignment: Weekly exercise 4: Word preprocessing

included files: freq.py
                README
                stop-words

instructions:
import sys and import string are used
run the file from the proper folder in the terminal using python3 preprocessing.py <mode>
where mode can be any one of keep-symbols, keep-stops, or keep-digits.
The program will return a space seperated list of all strings remaining
after being processed.

notes:
all credit was given in the code where the lines taken from the internet were used.
There is a little bit of hard coding (for the modes) in my code as I was getting a style
error of line to long and when I tried to fix it by moving part of the line to a newline
I was getting a syntax error when I tried to run my code.
