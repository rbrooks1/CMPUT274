course: CMPUT 274 fall 2018

assignment: Weekly exercise 2: Unfair Dice

included files: unfairDice.py
                README

instructions: 
import random was imported in the global section of the code
so it should be imported as well as importing the functions.
use import unfairDice to import the .py file for use in other code.
to run this code from the terminal use python3 unfairDice,py.
although there is a pass in the if __name__ == '__main__':
so nothing will happen if the function is called from the terminal.

notes: 
the original return value for the first function was changed 
from rolls to rollsList.
